## How to use Watson Assistant together with IBM RPA

### Introduction
July 8th, 2020 IBM announced acquiring WDG Automation to strengthen IBM DBA portfolio (https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises). Since then, we have already released several new versions of the solution and renamed it as IBM RPA.

One of the interesting capabilities that IBM RPA offers are IVAs, intelligent virtual agents.
