## How to use Watson Assistant together with IBM RPA

### Introduction
July 8th, 2020 IBM announced acquiring WDG Automation to strengthen IBM DBA portfolio (https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises). Since then, we have already released several new versions of the solution and renamed it as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTHBP_20.12/kc_welcome_rpa.html">IBM RPA</a>.

One of the interesting capabilities that IBM RPA offers are IVAs, intelligent virtual agents.
