# IBM RPA Watson Assistant Integration
## How to use Watson Assistant together with IBM RPA

### Introduction
July 8th, 2020 IBM announced acquiring WDG Automation to strengthen IBM DBA portfolio (https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises). Since then, we have already released several new versions of the solution and renamed it as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTHBP_20.12/kc_welcome_rpa.html">IBM RPA</a>.

One of the interesting capabilities that IBM RPA offers are IVAs, intelligent virtual agents. This is an embedded capability to create chatbots and chat dialogs using the RPA Studio - IBM RPA development IDE - and ready-made bot commands that it offers. Chatbots created using the RPA Studio can also be integrated to different channel applications as well as with IVR (Intelligent Voice Response Server) that can be used to integrate your chat dialog also to phone channel using the publicly available speech engines like Amazon, Google and IBM Watson.
